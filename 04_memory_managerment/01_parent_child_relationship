 - Each QObject instance may take a parent argument.
 - Child informs its parent about its existence
 - The parent does the following for its children
   - Deletes them, when it is self deleted
   - Hides and shows children, when hidden/shown itself
   - Enables and disables children when enabled or disabled itself


 = Objects inheriting from QObject are allocated on the heap using new.
   eg. QLabel *label = new QLabel("Some Text!", parent);
 = Objects not inheriting from QObject are allocated on the stack, not the heap
   eg. QStringList list; QColor color
 = Exceptions.
    QFile/QApplication are usually allocated on the stack
